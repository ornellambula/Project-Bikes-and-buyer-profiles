# Project-Bikes-and-buyer-profiles
This project looks at bike buyer profile's. 

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 'Bikes and buyer' project! 

In this project, I leveraged Excel to analyze a database and gain insights into the demographics of people purchasing bikes. Although this project is not based on real data, it showcases the potential usefulness of such an analysis for businesses seeking data-driven decision-making.

The project workflow involved several steps. First, I cleaned and processed the raw data using Excel's powerful data manipulation capabilities. This ensured that the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Next, I utilized pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of bike buyers' characteristics.

To present the findings effectively, I created dynamic dashboards using Excel's features, including slicers that allow users to filter and interact with the data. By utilizing the dashboard, businesses can gain insights into various aspects of their target market. They can determine optimal marketing strategies, identify demographics that exhibit higher bike purchase rates, and uncover reasons why certain groups show greater interest compared to others.

While this project is a demonstration, the techniques and insights derived from it can be invaluable for real businesses looking to make data-driven decisions. Feel free to explore the dashboard and adapt it to your own data or use it as a foundation for further analysis.

I have included a PDF file with a step by step and the actual dataset I used.
